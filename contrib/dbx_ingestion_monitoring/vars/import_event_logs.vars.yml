# Configuration variables for the shared jobs for importing event logs
variables:
  imported_event_logs_table_name:
    description: The name of the default table to use for importing event logs by the `import_event_logs` job.
    default: imported_event_logs
  imported_pipeline_ids:
    description: >
        A comma-separated list of CDC ingestion pipeline ids whose logs are to be imported. This should be used only for pipelines which are not
        configured to store their event logs into a Delta table. For those that are configured, use the `monitored_pipeline_ids` variable.
    default: ""
  imported_pipeline_tags:
    description: >
        A semicolon-separated list of comma-separated tag[:value] pairs to filter pipelines for importing event logs.
        Format: "tag1[:value1],tag2[:value2];tag3[:value3]"
        - Semicolons (;) separate tag groups (OR logic between groups)
        - Commas (,) separate tags within a group (ALL must match - AND logic)
        - 'tag' is shorthand for 'tag:' (tag with empty value)
        Example: "tier:T0;team:data,tier:T1" means (tier:T0) OR (team:data AND tier:T1)
        This is an alternative to specifying pipeline IDs explicitly via `imported_pipeline_ids`.
        If both are specified, pipelines matching either criteria will be included.
    default: ""
  import_event_log_schedule_state: 
    description: Enable (`UNPAUSED`) or disable (`PAUSED`) the periodic import of SDP event logs.
    default: PAUSED
  import_event_log_cron_schedule:
    description: >
        The cron schedule (see http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/crontrigger.html) to use for importing SDP event
        logs. Note that you also have to set `import_event_log_schedule_state` to `UNPAUSED` for this to take effect. The default is to run the
        import hourly.
    default: "0 15 0/1 * * ?"
  notification_emails:
    description: A list of e-mails to notify in case of failures
    type: complex
    default:
      - ${workspace.current_user.userName}
