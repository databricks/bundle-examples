# data-engineering template

This template introduces a new structure for organizing data-engineering
assets in DABs.

Install it using

```
databricks bundle init https://github.com/databricks/bundle-examples --template-dir contrib/templates/data-engineering
```

Note that by default this template doesn't come with any assets such as jobs or pipelines.
Follow the instructions in the template setup and README to add them.
