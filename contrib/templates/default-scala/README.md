# default-scala

This template helps you create Scala projects with Databricks Asset Bundles. It uses sbt to compile and package Scala files, and can be used with Databricks Connect for local development.

It supports two compute types: standard and serverless compute.

Run
```
databricks bundle init --template-dir contrib/templates/default-scala https://github.com/databricks/bundle-examples
```

and follow the generated README.md to get started.
